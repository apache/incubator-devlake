#Apache DevLake is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software
#Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC.
#
#Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review
#indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process
#have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects.
#
#While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code,
#it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
