# GitHub Copilot Dashboards

Grafana dashboards for analyzing GitHub Copilot usage and its correlation with developer productivity metrics.

## Dashboards

### 1. GitHub Copilot Adoption Dashboard (`GithubCopilotAdoption.json`)

**UID**: `copilot_adoption`

Tracks GitHub Copilot usage metrics across your organization:
- Active users and seat utilization
- Language breakdown of GitHub Copilot activity
- IDE distribution (VS Code, JetBrains, Neovim, etc.)
- Acceptance rates for code suggestions
- Chat and PR summary feature usage

### 2. GitHub Copilot Impact Dashboard (`GithubCopilotImpact.json`)

**UID**: `copilot_impact`

Correlates GitHub Copilot adoption with DORA metrics and engineering productivity:

#### Key Features

- **Correlation-First Analysis**: No implementation date required! Dashboard automatically correlates GitHub Copilot adoption intensity with productivity metrics.
- **Adoption Tier Comparison**: Groups metrics by adoption level (<25%, 25-50%, 50-75%, >75%)
- **Dual-Axis Charts**: See GitHub Copilot adoption trends alongside each DORA metric
- **Pearson Correlation Coefficients**: Statistical correlation (r) values for each metric pair
- **Optional Rollout Milestone**: Annotate specific dates when GitHub Copilot was rolled out to different teams

#### Panels by Section

| Section | Metrics Tracked |
|---------|-----------------|
| Correlation Overview | Adoption trend, aggregate correlation, current adoption % |
| PR Velocity Impact | PR cycle time, coding time, pickup time, review time, PR throughput |
| Deployment Frequency | Deploys per week, correlation with adoption |
| Change Failure Rate | CFR %, correlation (negative r = improvement) |
| Recovery Time (MTTR) | Mean time to recovery, adoption tier comparison |
| Code Review Time | Review time by adoption tier, trend analysis |
| Code Quality | Optional (requires SonarQube): complexity, coverage, duplicates |

#### Correlation Interpretation

The dashboard uses Pearson correlation coefficients (r):

| Value | Interpretation |
|-------|----------------|
| r > 0.7 | Strong positive correlation |
| 0.3 < r < 0.7 | Moderate correlation |
| r < 0.3 | Weak correlation |
| r < 0 | Negative correlation (for CFR/MTTR, negative = improvement) |

**Note**: For failure-related metrics (CFR, MTTR, Review Time), **negative** correlations are desirable - they indicate that higher GitHub Copilot adoption correlates with fewer failures or faster resolution.

## Prerequisites

These dashboards require:

1. **GitHub Copilot Plugin** (`gh-copilot`) - Configured and collecting data
2. **GitHub Plugin** - For PR metrics (`project_pr_metrics` table)
3. **DORA Metrics** - Deployments and incidents data from your CI/CD tools

## Configuration

### Variables

Both dashboards use these template variables:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `connection_id` | DevLake GitHub Copilot connection |
| `scope_id` | Enterprise/Organization scope |
| `project` | DevLake project filter |

### Optional: Rollout Milestone

To add an implementation date annotation:

1. Go to **Connections** > **GitHub Copilot** > Edit Scope
2. Set **Implementation Date** (when GitHub Copilot was rolled out)
3. Set **Baseline Period** (days to use for "before" comparison)

The dashboard works fully without these settings—correlation analysis doesn't require an implementation date.

## Data Model

The Impact Dashboard joins GitHub Copilot metrics with DORA data:

```sql
-- Weekly aggregation pattern
_copilot_adoption → _adoption_weekly (by week_start) 
                  → JOIN with metric CTEs (pr_metrics, deployments, incidents)
```

Key tables used:
- `_tool_copilot_org_metrics` - Daily GitHub Copilot usage
- `project_pr_metrics` - PR cycle time, review time
- `cicd_deployment_commits` - Deployment frequency, CFR
- `issues` (type='INCIDENT') - MTTR calculation
- `cq_file_metrics` - Code quality (SonarQube)

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "No data" on panels | Check that time range includes GitHub Copilot data; verify `scope_id` variable |
| Correlation shows "N/A" | Need at least 2 weeks of overlapping data |
| CFR/MTTR empty | Ensure incidents are collected (Jira/GitHub issues with 'incident' label) |
| Code Quality empty | Configure SonarQube integration |
