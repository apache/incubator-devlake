# Copilot Plugin (Adoption Metrics)

This directory mirrors the structure of other data-source plugins (e.g., `backend/plugins/q_dev`) and will host the GitHub Copilot adoption collector implementation.

## Structure
- `api/` – REST layer for connections, scopes, and helper endpoints
- `impl/` – Plugin metadata, options, and helper utilities
- `models/` – Tool-layer models and migration scripts
- `tasks/` – Collectors, extractors, and pipeline registrations
- `e2e/` – End-to-end fixtures and assertions for Copilot data flows

Additional documentation and code will be added in subsequent phases.
