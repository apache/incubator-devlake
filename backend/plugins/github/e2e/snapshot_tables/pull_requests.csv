This means that, instead of a `chan func() interface{}` as the message queue, we use a `chan interface{}`, and IMO this shouldn't warrant a completely different `Pool` implementation.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes the complete removal of the `worker_func.go` file, choosing instead to adapt `PoolWithFunc` to use the default `Pool`, changing `.Invoke` to simply call the underlying `Pool.Submit` method with an anonymous function wrapping `p.poolFunc(args)`, transforming it into a `goWorker` accepted task, giving us a more robust and simpler library.\r\n\r\n## 3.
