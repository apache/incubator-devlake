PluginBlueprintV200 for project support


step 1: blueprint.settings like
	{
		"version": "2.0.0",
		"connections": [
			{
				"plugin": "github",
				"connectionId": 123,
				"scopes": [
					{ "id": null, "name": "apache/incubator-devlake" }
				]
			}
		]
	}

step 2: call plugin PluginBlueprintV200.MakePipelinePlan with
	[
		{ "id": "1", "name": "apache/incubator-devlake" }
	]
	plugin would return PipelinePlan like the following json, and config-ui should use scopeName for displaying
	[
		[
			{ "plugin": "github", "options": { "scopeId": "1", "scopeName": "apache/incubator-devlake" } }
		]
	]
	and []Scope for project_mapping:
	[
		&Repo{ "id": "github:GithubRepo:1:1", "name": "apache/incubator-devlake" },
		&Board{ "id": "github:GithubRepo:1:1", "name": "apache/incubator-devlake" }
	]

step 3: framework should maintain the project_mapping table based on the []Scope array
	[
		{ "projectName": "xxx", "table": "repos", "rowId": "github:GithubRepo:1:1" },
		{ "projectName": "xxx", "table": "boards", "rowId": "github:GithubRepo:1:1" },
	]
