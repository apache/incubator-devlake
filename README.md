## 🤔 What is Apache DevLake?

[Apache DevLake](https://devlake.apache.org) is an open-source dev data platform that ingests, analyzes, and visualizes the fragmented data from DevOps tools to extract insights for engineering excellence, developer experience, and community growth.

Apache DevLake is used by Engineering Leads, Open Source Software Maintainers and development teams looking to make better sense of their development process and to bring a more data-driven approach to their own practices. You can ask Apache DevLake many questions regarding your development process. Just connect and query.

## 🎯 What can be accomplished with Apache DevLake?

1. Your Dev Data lives in many silos and tools. DevLake brings them all together to give you a complete view of your Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
2. From [DORA](https://dora.dev/guides/dora-metrics-four-keys/) to scrum retros, DevLake implements metrics effortlessly with prebuilt dashboards supporting common frameworks and goals.
3. DevLake fits teams of all shapes and sizes, and can be readily extended to support new data sources, metrics, and dashboards, with a flexible framework for data collection and transformation.

## 👉 Live Demos

The main way you interact with DevLake is through the integrated dashboards powered by [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana).

[Dashboards for OSS Maintainers](https://devlake.apache.org/livedemo/OSSMaintainers)

## 💪 Supported Data Sources

DevLake supports connections to many popular development tools, including GitHub, GitLab, Jenkins, Jira, Sonarqube and more. [Here](https://devlake.apache.org/docs/Overview/SupportedDataSources) you can find all data sources supported by DevLake, their scopes, supported versions and more!

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

You can set up Apache DevLake by following our step-by-step instructions for either Docker Compose or Helm. Feel free to [ask the community](#💙-community) if you get stuck at any point.

- [Install via Docker Compose](https://devlake.apache.org/docs/GettingStarted/DockerComposeSetup)
- [Install via Helm](https://devlake.apache.org/docs/GettingStarted/HelmSetup)

## 🤓 Usage

Please see [detailed usage instructions](https://devlake.apache.org/docs/Overview/Introduction#how-do-i-use-devlake). Here's an overview on how to get started using DevLake.

### 1. Set up DevLake

Install using either [Docker Compose](https://devlake.apache.org/docs/GettingStarted/DockerComposeSetup) or [Helm](https://devlake.apache.org/docs/GettingStarted/HelmSetup).

### 2. Create a Blueprint

The DevLake Configuration UI will guide you through the process (a Blueprint) to define the data connections, data scope, transformation and sync frequency of the data you wish to collect.

### 3. Track the Blueprint's progress

You can track the progress of the Blueprint you have just set up.

### 4. View the pre-built dashboards

Once the first run of the Blueprint is completed, you can view the corresponding dashboards.

### 5. Customize the dashboards with SQL

If the pre-built dashboards are limited for your use cases, you can always customize or create your own metrics or dashboards with SQL.
