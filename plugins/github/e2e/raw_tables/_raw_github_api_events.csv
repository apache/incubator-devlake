the bug**\r\nWhen the `Pool.Release()` function is called, it can leave the `purgePeriodically` function running until its heartbeat `time.Ticker` triggers, at which point the condition on whether the pool is closed is checked by the `purgePeriodically` for loop. \r\n\r\nThe issue is that one cannot assume the goroutines associated with an ant pool are completely cleaned up until the `purgePeriodically` function is completed - and as such, tools like goleak (https://github.com/uber-go/goleak) will report a leaked goroutine in tests. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Clone https://github.com/loopholelabs/frisbee\r\n2. Check out the `rpc-async` branch\r\n3. Run `go test ./...`\r\n4. See error\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe `purgePeriodically` goroutine is closed when the `Release` function returns.\r\n\r\n**Error messages/Trace logs**\r\n```bash\r\ngoleak: Errors on successful test run: found unexpected goroutines:\r\n[Goroutine 4 in state chan receive, with github.com/panjf2000/ants/v2.(*Pool).purgePeriodically on top of the stack:\r\ngoroutine 4 [chan receive]:\r\ngithub.com/panjf2000/ants/v2.(*Pool).purgePeriodically(0x14000140000)\r\n        /Users/shivanshvij/go/pkg/mod/github.com/panjf2000/ants/v2@v2.4.7/pool.go:69 +0x80\r\ncreated by github.com/panjf2000/ants/v2.NewPool\r\n        /Users/shivanshvij/go/pkg/mod/github.com/panjf2000/ants/v2@v2.4.7/pool.go:137 +0x380\r\n]\r\nFAIL    github.com/loopholelabs/frisbee 10.624s\r\n```\r\n\r\n**System info (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: macOS\r\n - Go Version: 1.17.6\r\n - ants version: 2.4.7\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\r\n"",""reactions"":{""url"":""https://api.github.com/repos/panjf2000/ants/issues/212/reactions"",""total_count"":0,""+1"":0,""-1"":0,""laugh"":0,""hooray"":0,""confused"":0,""heart"":0,""rocket"":0,""eyes"":0},""timeline_url"":""https://api.github.com/repos/panjf2000/ants/issues/212/timeline"",""performed_via_github_app"":null,""state_reason"":""completed""},""performed_via_github_app"":null}",https://api.github.com/repos/panjf2000/ants/issues/events?direction=asc&page=1&per_page=100&state=all,null,2022-06-13 15:36:05.518034+00:00

Please describe how these code changes achieve your intention.\r\n<!-- Please be specific. Motivate the problem, and justify why this is the best solution. -->\r\n\r\nWhile reading through the library it became clear to me that `PoolWithFunc` was just a specific case of `Pool`, where instead of submitting tasks, the caller simply passes arguments for a pre-defined function to be run on the workers. This means that, instead of a `chan func() interface{}` as the message queue, we use a `chan interface{}`, and IMO this shouldn't warrant a completely different `Pool` implementation.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes the complete removal of the `worker_func.go` file, choosing instead to adapt `PoolWithFunc` to use the default `Pool`, changing `.Invoke` to simply call the underlying `Pool.Submit` method with an anonymous function wrapping `p.poolFunc(args)`, transforming it into a `goWorker` accepted task, giving us a more robust and simpler library.\r\n\r\n## 3. Please link to the relevant issues (if any).\r\n<!-- This adds crucial context to your change. -->\r\n\r\n## 4.

Every reviewer is a volunteer, and each has their own style.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## 1. Are you opening this pull request for bug-fixs, optimizations or new feature?\r\n\r\nSimplifying the library\r\n\r\n## 2. Please describe how these code changes achieve your intention.\r\n<!-- Please be specific. Motivate the problem, and justify why this is the best solution. -->\r\n\r\nWhile reading through the library it became clear to me that `PoolWithFunc` was just a specific case of `Pool`, where instead of submitting tasks, the caller simply passes arguments for a pre-defined function to be run on the workers. This means that, instead of a `chan func() interface{}` as the message queue, we use a `chan interface{}`, and IMO this shouldn't warrant a completely different `Pool` implementation.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes the complete removal of the `worker_func.go` file, choosing instead to adapt `PoolWithFunc` to use the default `Pool`, changing `.Invoke` to simply call the underlying `Pool.Submit` method with an anonymous function wrapping `p.poolFunc(args)`, transforming it into a `goWorker` accepted task, giving us a more robust and simpler library.\r\n\r\n## 3. Please link to the relevant issues (if any).\r\n<!-- This adds crucial context to your change. -->\r\n\r\n## 4. Which documentation changes (if any) need to be made/updated because of this PR?\r\n<!-- Reviewers will often reference this first in order to know what to expect from the change. Please be specific enough so that they can paste your wording into the documentation directly. -->\r\n\r\nNo documentation changes are needed as this doesn't change any of API or examples used.\r\n\r\n## 4.

Please describe how these code changes achieve your intention.\r\n<!-- Please be specific. Motivate the problem, and justify why this is the best solution. -->\r\n\r\nWhile reading through the library it became clear to me that `PoolWithFunc` was just a specific case of `Pool`, where instead of submitting tasks, the caller simply passes arguments for a pre-defined function to be run on the workers. This means that, instead of a `chan func() interface{}` as the message queue, we use a `chan interface{}`, and IMO this shouldn't warrant a completely different `Pool` implementation.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes the complete removal of the `worker_func.go` file, choosing instead to adapt `PoolWithFunc` to use the default `Pool`, changing `.Invoke` to simply call the underlying `Pool.Submit` method with an anonymous function wrapping `p.poolFunc(args)`, transforming it into a `goWorker` accepted task, giving us a more robust and simpler library.\r\n\r\n## 3. Please link to the relevant issues (if any).\r\n<!-- This adds crucial context to your change. -->\r\n\r\n## 4. Which documentation changes (if any) need to be made/updated because of this PR?\r\n<!-- Reviewers will often reference this first in order to know what to expect from the change.

Please describe how these code changes achieve your intention.\r\n<!-- Please be specific. Motivate the problem, and justify why this is the best solution. -->\r\n\r\nWhile reading through the library it became clear to me that `PoolWithFunc` was just a specific case of `Pool`, where instead of submitting tasks, the caller simply passes arguments for a pre-defined function to be run on the workers. This means that, instead of a `chan func() interface{}` as the message queue, we use a `chan interface{}`, and IMO this shouldn't warrant a completely different `Pool` implementation.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes the complete removal of the `worker_func.go` file, choosing instead to adapt `PoolWithFunc` to use the default `Pool`, changing `.Invoke` to simply call the underlying `Pool.Submit` method with an anonymous function wrapping `p.poolFunc(args)`, transforming it into a `goWorker` accepted task, giving us a more robust and simpler library.\r\n\r\n## 3.
